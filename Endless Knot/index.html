                            For this project, I wanted to use code to make something simple, yet meaningful to me. 
                            This creative computation project uses python to create an endless knot, which is 
                            one of the 8 symbols of Buddhism.

                            I recently bought a book, 
                            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/There-No-Suffering-Commentary-Heart/dp/1556433859" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>There Is No Suffering: A Commentary on the Heart Sutra</i></a>, 
                            by Master Sheng Yen and one of the concepts I’ve learned from the book is “Form is emptiness and emptiness is form” (色即是空，空即是色). 
                        </p>

                            Although it took me a while to understand this phrase, it inspired me to code one of the 
                            symbols of Buddhism using python. The endless knot seems to have no beginning and no end. 
                            The knot can represent many things, and to me, one of the biggest meanings from the loop 
                            is that it represents the interconnectedness of all things. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “Form is emptiness and emptiness 
                            is form”: form is emptiness because it lacks independence– it is always changing and doesn’t 
                            have anything internal/permanent about it. That is why there is the interconnectedness of all 
                            things. Nothing in this world is independent of any other things. If it was true that an object 
                            can be independent of existence, then it wouldn’t be able to interact with other things, and 
                            we wouldn’t know of its existence. Hence, form is emptiness because it isn’t internal, is 
                            impermanent, and is dependent on conditions. Additionally, emptiness is form. Since form lacks 
                            any independence, it allows any form to be established from dependent-arising. Connecting the 
                            saying about form and emptiness to the endless knot, I decided to code the endless knot using python.

                            For the first attempt, I grabbed a scratch paper to draw out a coordinate plane. I roughly planned out where to draw 
                            my borders. After coding the first border, I repeated the same steps and drew two more borders outside my first border, 
                            increasing in size every time.

                            I looked up some designs on google images to see which ones were doable, and it gave me ideas on how I should make my corner designs. 
                            First, throughout trial and error, I coded the design on the bottom left corner. Copying the same code but switching 
                            the directions and changing the x-axis and y-axis positions, I repeated the steps for the bottom-right, upper-left and 
                            upper-right corners.    
                        </p>

                            With the corner designs complete, I moved onto coding the biggest challenge: the endless knot. No doubt, there are 
                            many different approaches on how to first do this. I decided to code the “boxes” first, then lastly 
                            code the right angles being intertwined into each other. 
                        </p>

                            This process took a lot of time because sometimes, some pieces of the knot varied in “thickness” and it took a lot 
                            of time to “trim” and “add” thickness. After completing the knot, I asked a lot of my friends by sending screenshots 
                            to them to confirm if it was okay-to-go, but they made me realize it was uncentered...unfortunately! Realizing that 
                            it would be more of a pain to fix the code piece by piece versus just remaking the whole thing was easier, I decided 
                            to redo the project. Here is a screenshot of the first attempt:

                            For my second and final attempt, since I was now a “pro” at doing this (just kidding), it was a lot faster and took me less time to complete.

                            Firstly, I coded the borders again, but this time, using the handy-dandy scratch paper, I drew a coordinate plane again, 
                            and made sure to use constant values marks (0, 30, 60…). After making sure my borders were actually centered and good to 
                            go on the screen, I moved on to working on the corner designs. Essentially, I just copied the code from the previous code 
                            to the new code. With some editing of the length and x-axis/y-axis position, I fixed it in no time.

                            Secondly, with the borders and corner designs finished and centered, I decided to code the lines to mimic a coordinate 
                            graph, so that way, I won’t have to worry about the center-piece being uncentered.

                            Thirdly, using the graph as a tool to align my sections to the knot, I started to code the knot. I coded the boxes 
                            accordingly, then when all of the boxes seemed good to go, I started to code the rest of the knot: the right angles.

                            This was my first time making art with python and although it was frustrating at first, it did get some time to get used to. 
                            With two tries, I’ve created what I had in mind: an Endless Knot. Next time, I would just start with coding the coordinate 
                            graph to make everything easier for myself, so I don’t have to worry about the graphics being uncentered.
