                            Polymath: A person with extraordinarily wide-ranging knowledge.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            My name is Annmarie Cong, an aspiring polymath. I am passionate about utilizing creativity 
                            and empathy to help others. I enjoy learning new things, developing an understanding to new 
                            things, and applying what I’ve learned to think of creative solutions to solve problems.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            I am studying cognitive science and digital humanities at University of California, Los Angeles. 
                            Both of these studies are interdisciplinary studies that allowed me to learn a variety of technical 
                            skills and subjects– such as psychology, anthropology, philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science. 
                            During my spare time, I apply these skills to create design projects in hopes of solving
                            problems that I see in my everyday life, and from creating these projects, I hope to learn something 
                            new everytime. 
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="sub_h2">My Values...</h2>
                    <h3><b>COMPASSION</b></h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        <i>“Simply deal with matters with wisdom and treat people with compassion, without worrying 
                        about personal gain or loss. Then we'll never be plagued by vexations” — Master Sheng Yen</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Compassion is the stepping stone to understanding another’s situation. It drives us 
                        to take action to give out a helping hand. Compassion is important in dissolving hate, injustice 
                        and ignorance. I believe that if one takes steps to try to become compassionate, they will 
                        be able to give a deeper meaning to everything they do. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3><b>HUMILITY</b></h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        <i>“With pride, there are many curses. With humility, there come many blessings.” — Ezra Taft Benson</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Humility, or humbleness, is one of the important factors to self-improvement. By putting our ego and 
                        pride aside, it will allow individuals to recognize what they can improve on and allow them to see 
                        their own potential to grow.  
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3><b>PASSION</b></h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        <i>“The only way to do great work is to love what you do.” — Steve Jobs</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love seeing the passion people have in the things they do: it shows motivation, drive, and hard work. 
                        People with passion drives me to work even harder for the things I love and enjoy, and I hope I can spread 
                        the same energy to other people! 
                    </p>
                    <br/><hr/>
                    <h2 class="sub_h2">My Interests...</h2>
                    <h3><b>DESIGN</b></h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        Design is ideating a creative solution for a problem. It is about the process that the designer goes 
                        through that inspires me to aspire to become a designer. The best thing about design is that this 
                        process is different for everyone and everyone can generate their own creative solution to a problem.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3><b>TECHNOLOGY</b></h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        Technology has helped make lives easier for many people. As this world and people’s needs are 
                        ever-changing, I hope to be able to ease the gap of technology and people’s need. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h3><b>CULTURES AND ART</b></h3>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        As an Asian-American growing up in America, it was definitely hard to learn more about my Asian side. 
                        That is why I am always motivated to learn more about my culture, such as reading more about my 
                        history to learning how to write new Chinese characters! My goal is to be able to read and 
                        comprehend 3,000 Chinese characters!
