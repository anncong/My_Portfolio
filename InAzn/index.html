                    <h3>Motivation and Design Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Making friends with similar struggles, interests, and cultural backgrounds in college is a shared common 
                        difficulty that most people have. Many will join cultural clubs with the purpose of mingling, getting to 
                        know more people, and hoping to learn more about their cultures. However, most of the time, these cultural 
                        clubs are just too big of a group to actually have one-on-one conversations with others. There are also 
                        groups on Facebook, such as Subtle Asian Traits and its variations, however 
                        these groups mainly consist of meme-tagging with your friends and it doesn’t really allow for learning about culture and 
                        making friends. Additionally, since the dominant culture in America is the western culture, it is easy for 
                        one, such as an Asian descent, to lose touch with their cultural roots. With these problems in mind, I 
                        wanted to make a product that intends to connect people together with similar backgrounds and interests 
                        while promoting cultural connectedness and awareness. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Methods & Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        I will do a heuristic evaluation of current apps to draw comparisons to what can be improved and what is good about 
                        the app. For the contextual inquiry, I will start interviewing the target users to gather data about their current 
                        methods on connecting and meeting new people and what they look for in meeting new people. After obtaining data, 
                        I will use UX Storytelling methods to ideate a solution. I will then create a flowchart, wireframe/lo-fi prototype 
                        for visualizations and then testing out the wireframe with random people to look for improvements. With the feedback, 
                        I hope to make revisions to improve the project.

                        Friendships consist of a mutual and affectionate relationship between two friends. Under this term “friendship”, 
                        there are many different types, and more recently emerging are online friendships. Online friendships are 
                        developed in online social environments, such as chat rooms or social media, through computer-mediated 
                        communications (CMC). In these online environments, such as Facebook, it is suggested that there are possible 
                        mental health and well-being benefits that are associated with the feeling of connectedness to others (Grieve et al., 2013). 
                        Although online friendships tend to develop slower initially, after passing a critical period, which is around six 
                        months to a year, the quality of the online friendship grows quickly (Chan and Cheng, 2000). This feeling of 
                        connectedness, belongingness, and relatedness is called social connectedness (Smolders & De Kort, 2009). Social 
                        connectedness contributes to greater subjective well-being because it acts as a mediator for how people come to 
                        understand their social experiences, which influences their relationship-enhancing behaviors (Lee et al., 2008).
                    </p>

                        In America, Asians may feel, think, and act American, however, they are repeatedly treated as if they 
                        are aliens and do not belong in America to the same degree as other Americans (Cheryan & Monin, 2005). Asian 
                        Americans are suggested to be more likely to be mistaken for being from another country or be a non-native 
                        English speaker compared to White Americans (Cheryan & Monin, 2005). In other words, the repeated exclusion 
                        from society that Asian Americans go through can greatly impact their psychology and behavior. This 
                        study explores the factors of empowering cultural connectedness through online friendships. Cultural 
                        connectedness can mean different things in different contexts. However, specifically for this 
                        study, cultural connectedness encompasses how much Asian descents are and feel integrated with their 
                        heritage and ethnic culture. The more a person feels culturally connected to their respected culture 
                        may suggest a higher self-efficacy, sense of self regarding time, school connectedness, and life 
                        satisfaction (Snowshoe 2015). Therefore, this study will investigate the interconnection between an individual's 
                        cultural heritage and cultural community with respect to cultural connectedness. The study findings will 
                        contribute to the cultural studies of online behavior especially how to model to establish online friends 
                        with similar struggles, interests, and cultural backgrounds.

                    <h3>What are the things users would do with the app?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The main activity my project will support for the users is connecting Asian descents through an app in 
                        hopes to promote cultural awareness. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the basic needs involved 
                        for this project are psychological, which includes the feeling of belongingness and love, such as 
                        friendships, romantic relationships, trust and acceptance, family, and a sense of connectedness. The 
                        traditional solutions to satisfy people's need for belongingness and love ranges from big to small 
                        groups. Some examples of big groups include clubs, sports events, and work. Additionally, 
                        some examples of smaller groups that satisfy these needs are forming friendships, romantic 
                        relationships and family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some possible limitations with the traditional methods for satisfying the psychological needs for 
                        belongingness and love are that people are limited with people in their area. For my project, I am aiming 
                        to create a platform for Asians descents to get connected to promote cultural awareness and connectedness, 
                        since it is common for an individual's community not to have a cultural center or a large demographics of 
                        people that share the same cultural background. On another note, more and more apps and social media are 
                        enabling people to connect over the internet. In other words, people can connect virtually in the form of 
                        online friendships and romantic relationships. So, although the idea of connecting online is not something 
                        completely new, I hope to utilize this technology to help with the limitation in which people do not have 
                        to be limited to their area in order to connect with people who share the same cultural background as them.

                    <h3>Target Users</h3>
                    <p>
                        The nature of this study is to look into Asian descents, so regarding the inclusion criteria for my target 
                        users, this study will be limited to Asians. The age criteria will be adults who are competent to give 
                        informed consent, so 18 years or older. Also, gender is non-discriminatory. In the consent form, the participants 
                        are screened to see if they understand the written consent information and assume that the participant who checks 
                        and agrees will have at least intermediate proficiency in English. In a typical setting, the user will use this 
                        app during their free time, typically in the morning or during the evening. The user will open the app to socialize 
                        and to learn more about their culture.
                    </p>
                    <br/><hr/>
                    <h3>Research Design and Methods</h3>
                    <p>
                        A factor analysis was used for the initial analysis. Therefore, by the rule of thumb by calculating 10 
                        subjects per variable (10x20 questions), 200 is an optimized-ideal target sample size. 200 participants 
                        were invited via an online forum and were asked to answer 20 questions regarding the attitude toward 
                        cultural heritage and online socialization. These questions are on a likert-scale: “Strongly Disagree”, 
                        “Disagree”, “Neutral”, “Agree” and “Strongly Agree”. However by assuming the 20% of total participants 
                        may drop or be removed during the cleanup process due to invalid/missing data rate, I recruited 250 
                        participants. Personal reflection about the participant's experience in the cultural community will be 
                        asked by six open-ended questions. The survey would take approximately 15 minutes to complete and each 
                        participant had only one chance to complete the survey.                   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The findings of this research will contribute to the appreciation of diversity in society by encouraging 
                        cultural connectedness and by promoting cultural awareness and identity.The results of the research 
                        may inspire more research regarding cultural connectedness and ways to promote cultural awareness and identity.

                            loadings, my cut off value to determine significance was 0.3, such that if the loading was less than 0.3, 
                            I would consider them insignificant. To find the communalities, I subtracted 1 from the uniqueness. My cut 
                            off value was 0.5, such that if the communalities were less than 0.5, I would consider them insignificant.

                        "Online Connections" had high loadings with these items from the survey: I made online friends 
                        before; I have had good experiences before from meeting people through social media. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Cultural Learning" had high loadings with these items: meeting more people with the same cultural 
                        background with me will make me feel more connected to my culture; being more culturally connected 
                        would make me feel more content; having a cultural community would be helpful in learning about 
                        my culture; making online friends with the same cultural background as me is a great way for me to 
                        learn more about my culture; making online friends is a great way to connect with people from other 
                        places; I spend more than half my time on the internet on social media. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        "Physical Cultural Community" had high loadings with these items: have friends with the
                        same cultural backgrounds; besides from family, I have a lot of exposure to my culture; there are a lot of
                        people with the same cultural background as me in the area I live in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Language Building" had high loadings with these items: I am literate in my cultural language's 
                        writing system; I am fluent in my cultural language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Online Safety" had high loadings with: I feel unsafe making online friends; I distrust the 
                        internet for making online friends; I have had bad experiences before from meeting people through social media.
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        "Cultural Exposure" had high loadings with: I took a language course that is my
                        cultural language./I am currently taking a language that is my cultural language; I attended a 
                        cultural school before/I am currently attending one.
                    </p> 
                       
                    <p>
                        The communalities of the variables included a few high variances: I am literate in my cultural
                        language's writing system; I distrust the internet for making online friends. This may mean that the
                        proportion of each variable's variance can only be mediocrely explained by these factors, since only about
                        half of the variables have 0.5 or greater communalities. However, the test of the hypothesis stated that six
                        factors were sufficient for this factor analysis. The p-value is 0.0244, which indicates that we can reject
                        the null hypothesis. Substantively, this means that this factor analysis has identified six patterns of
                        responses: online connections, cultural learning, physical cultural community, language building, online
                        safety, and cultural exposure. These factors are independent of each other.

                    <h3>Reflection and Design Implications</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this study is to look at methods of improving social connections in the Asian
                        community by tying in cultural values. In other words, this study aimed to look into how Asians can
                        connect culturally over a social app and ways to promote cultural awareness in these Asian communities.
                        With the results from the factor analysis, there are six patterns found in this study. Utilizing these
                        patterns found, some possible design methods to promote cultural connectedness in Asian communities
                        would be making it possible for users to cultivate treasurable online connections, improve mutual
                        cultural learning, utilizing physical cultural communities available, engage in language building activities
                        and exercises, emphasizing on online safety, and lastly, accentuating on cultural exposure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For my design direction, I will focus more on these factors– cultural learning, online connections
                        and safety. Some possible design ideas for "cultural learning" would be the possibility for users to meet
                        people with similar backgrounds, engaging in mutual cultural learning, and to form intimate
                        communities; for the factor "online connections", organizing a way for users to easily make friends
                        individually and be in groups may help the cultivation of online connections; and lastly, for "online safety",
                        giving users an option to report and block potential trolls on the internet may help the users with
                        promoting the feeling of security and control (users can block and report whoever they find troubling).

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                     <p>
                        Based on some of the responses from the reflection questions, a lot of the participants had comments about 
                        how most online groups aren't geared towards actual learning and just merely meme-tagging. 
                        Additionally, many also were afraid that being in an online group or becoming friends with people 
                        who have a similar cultural background would lower the diversity of their friend group. So from these 
                        responses, I made two personas with 2 scenarios each to best reflect them: June Sun and Jan Chakara.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Utilizing the data from my research, I used an empathy map to best capture the knowledge about a 
                        user's behaviors and attitudes, which includes their feelings, thoughts, what they said and done. 
                        This helped me to keep the personas in mind and try my best to design for the users (user-centered 
                        designs). Additionally, the way the empathy map is structured made it more convenient for me to 
                        access what the persona is feeling, thinking, doing, and saying. The storyboard is a visual representation 
                        of the scenarios. This helped me capture the main ideas of what I should do for the low fidelity prototype.

                    <p>
                        I made wireframes using for each scenario per persona. I made sure to follow the scenario 
                        as closely as possible, while utilizing the data from the user research and keeping in mind the factors 
                        I chose to focus on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the usability test, my task for the participant was similar to the scenarios. My first set of tasks were 
                        mirrored from June's scenarios, which included: signing up, publish a memoir, meet someone new by sending a 
                        message, and lastly, to accept a group invitiation. My second set of tasks were mirrored from Jan's 
                        scenarios: logging in, looking for a group, joining it, and inviting a friend to a group. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, the participant for the usability test thought that the wireframes were pretty self-explanatory, such that
                        they made sense, was clear cut and detailed enough to know which part was for what according to the tasks. Some critque 
                        and suggestions I recieved was that I should utilize color to organize the categories. In other words, I should use 
                        colors to make certain things "stick" out to separate important information and details. Also, from analyzing the participant's feedback
                        and reactions, I decided to change the preference and interest page and split it into two parts. Also, I decided to change my 
                        log in/sign up screen to separate the screens instead of combining the two processes at once.

                    <p>
                        Initially, I was deciding between these two designs. The first design on the left is a very straightforward
                        implementation of a sign up or login screen. The arrow pointing towards the left would bring the user back to the
                        starter screen with the logo, and on the starter screen, there will be an arrow on the bottom pointing to the right
                        and when clicked, it would bring the use back to the login or sign up screen. The second design carries the same 
                        function but looks a bit different from the typical sign up or logins. I decided to go with the second one because 
                        the swipe up transition was more attractive.

                    <p>
                        I wanted a darker color for my background to represent a more controlled and secure feeling towards the app utilizing the
                        data I got from the factor analysis (one of the factors was online safety), so I chose these three colors to get an 
                        opinion from others. After asking a few of my friends, they suggested the purple-ish color (the screen on the most 
                        right) because it matched the logo color (complementary colors). So I ended up choosing the purplish color for 
                        my main background color. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These are the main colors that I used. The rest of the colors I used are green/red for buttons that has the actions of 
                        accepting or denying another action, grays for borders and signifying the navigation bar of the current page, blues 
                        for "comment" areas, and a super light gray/white color to substitute #FFFFFF white as much as possible to reduce high contrast.

                    <p>
                        The usability test took place in Oakland, CA. The room contained a desk, a laptop, the moderator and the participant. 
                        The test was conducted to test how easy and intuitive the designs of the app were in regard to the tasks. 
                        The participant was asked to complete six tasks: Signing up and publishing a memoir, meeting someone new and 
                        sending them a message, accepting a group invitation, inviting a friend to a group, logging in to search and join a 
                        group, and lastly, accepting a match request from a new user.

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Based on the feedback from the usability evaluation, I changed the navigation bar. It was hard to find a 
                        good icon with the limited icons, so I thought the message icon and a plus-sign icon would suffice the duty 
                        to: meet and message new people, and check for match/message requests
                    </p>

                    <h3>Beginning Screen</h3>

                    <p>
                        I removed the arrow because my participants seemed to hesitate and get confused on whether they should click on the 
                        arrow or on the icon from the navigation bar. So, I decided to just remove the arrow. 
                    </p>

                    <br/><hr/>
                    <h3>Scrolling Screens</h3>
                    <div class="screens">
                        <a href="https://github.com/anncong/DH_199S/blob/master/change_scroll.png?raw=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="revision to scrolling screen"><img src="https://github.com/anncong/DH_199S/blob/master/change_scroll.png?raw=true" alt="revision to scrolling screen"/></a>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        For the scrolling screen, initially I wasn't too skilled with working with Adobe Xd but later I figured out how to make the 
                        navigation bar fixed on the screen for scrolling purposes. So, for the scrolling screens, I moved the navigation bar back to the 
                        end of the original sized screen (along with the new navigation bar).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Others</h3>
                    <p>
                        The other issues like the connectors were easily fixed. However, for the icons that made the user confused due to its 
                        unintuitive nature, I tried to fix it by changing the icon to the messaging icon, as stated above. Additionally, one 
                        of the participants also stated that most new apps take time to learn its functionality, so perhaps with more exposure, 
                        the functionalities and layout will become more intuitive.

                    <p>
                        America is known to be a melting pot, however along the way, most people may feel less inclined to learn more about their heritage 
                        and culture. This product is just an example of how those who seek to be more connected culturally and to find more like them 
                        can use this product to promote cultural connectedness by making friends online. This has been a fun project to do! I've enjoyed 
                        learning lots about the people who participated in my user research, ideating on a possible solution to the problem, and prototyping the ideas. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For future projects, I will definitely dedicate more time for literature review, as that helped me to know what to focus on 
                        and learn more about what has already been studied. Additionally, since it was hard to get participants due to COVID-19 and 
                        quarantine, next time if I have the chance, I would definitely invest more time into user research and usability testing because 
                        it gave me incredible insight on what to improve, what worked, and getting more experience with designing for users.
