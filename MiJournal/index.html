                    <p>
                        Journaling is a good way to help improve mental health. The basic need involved in journaling, 
                        according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, will be safety. The current solutions to satisfy the 
                        needs of safety includes tracking one's physical activities, calorie consumption, sleep, and mood. 
                        Currently, the journaling apps available are not satisfactory because it is not engaging enough, which makes
                        the user inconsistent with journaling. This could possibly be improved with digital technology by having levels, 
                        in which the user can level up by journaling consistently and with each level up, the user will unlock awards.

                    <h3>Brief Description:</h3>
                    <p>
                        From my analysis, Aloe Bud is an all-in-one tracker that brings awareness to self-care exercises and 
                        activities by encouraging users using push notifications. This app contains: activity cards, scheduled 
                        push notifications, and an activity log.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Overall Evaluation of the App:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Aloe Bud is a simple app that allows one to easily track their habits as they progress their day. It 
                        is very easy to use all of the features: making a new activity card, checking my activity log, and having 
                        the push notifications on to remind the user daily. Although simple, one of the major issue about the app 
                        that made it confusing was the ambiguity of the icons and their descriptions. For example, under the hydrate 
                        category for making a new activity card, there is a cactus icon. Without clicking on the icon, at first glance, 
                        it already seems irrelevant. After you click it on cactus icon, there is a description about the cactus stating 
                        that it is more hydrated than the soil around it. I didn’t quite see the relevance; I don’t think figurative 
                        language should be used here. To fix this, I suggest, either combining similar icons into one, or in the 
                        description of the cactus, have a more straight-to-the-point description.​​​​​​​
                    </p>

                <h2>Documentation for Usability Test</h2>
                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>
                    Aloe Bud serves as a multi-purpose tracker to help users become aware of self-care exercises and 
                    activities by utilizing different activity cards, activity logs and push notifications to act as reminders. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>Setting of the Pilot Usability Test:</h3>
                <p>
                    I conducted the usability test in Los Angeles, CA on October 21st, 2019 for the Aloe Bud 
                    app using my iPhone 7 plus to gain access to the app, a MacBook Pro to record the participant 
                    doing the pilot test to capture the facial expressions and comments. The session captured each 
                    participant’s navigational choices, task completion rates, comments, and overall satisfaction ratings. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>Rationale Behind Usability Testing:</h3>
                <p>
                    The purpose of a usability test about aloe bud was to see how easy the app was and how intuitive the icons were.  
                </p>

                <h3>Usability Testing Based on my Heuristic Findings:</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on my heuristic findings, I found that the aesthetic and minimalistic design, match between real 
                    world and systems, and recognition and recall were the major issues. In regards to the findings in 
                    Aloe Bud, I wanted to test these few things: creating activity cards, checking in the activity cards, 
                    reviewing the activity log, and looking for external mental health resources. I will test these by designing 
                    specific tasks that will look for how easy it is to create specific activity cards tailored towards specific 
                    needs by locating a specific category and icon, how easy it is to find the activity log icon and checking 
                    in the activity, and how easy it is to find extra mental health resources given a specific scenario. 
                </p>
                <h3>Process of the Pilot Usability Test:</h3>
                <p>
                    The participant is a friend of mine from UCLA. The test session lasted approximately half an hour. During the 
                    session, I explained the test session (orientation and consent form) and asked the participant to fill out a 
                    brief background questionnaire at the end of the survey. The participant read the task scenarios and tried to 
                    find the information on the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of each task, I asked the participant to check if the tasks were completed by checking the box on the form. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the last task was completed, I asked the participant to rate the app overall by using a 7-point Likert scale 
                    (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree) for eight subjective measures including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ease of use</li>
                    <li>Frequency of use</li>
                    <li>Difficulty to keep track of location in website</li>
                    <li>Learn ability - how easy it would be for most users to learn to use the website</li>
                    <li>Information facilitation – how quickly participant could find information</li>
                    <li>Look & feel appeal – homepage’s content makes me want to explore the site further</li>
                    <li>Site content – site’s content would keep me coming back</li>
                    <li>Site organization</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, I asked the participant to select 5 adjectives to describe the experience and personal reactions 
                    in using the app from the list modified from NNgroup.
                </p>     
                <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                <p>
                    I think the usability test went fairly well: the tasks went smoothly, the participant ran into issues and continued 
                    to push through, the app did not crash and the video recording went well. Some things that did not go well 
                    during the usability test included reading the scripts in a calmer tone, keeping my facial expression neutral, 
                    and being aware of my body position. In the future, I want to be more aware of the position of being the 
                    moderator and not biasing the test. Some major findings from the test was that the participant was confused on the difference 
                    between the icons and on finding a specific external mental health resource. 
                </p>

                <h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
                <h3>Target Users:</h3>
                <p>
                    The characteristics of the target users will be students, preferably college or high school, who wants to start jotting 
                    down their life events. The age range will be from adolescent or young adults to any age. Gender and demographics are 
                    nondiscriminatory; anyone is welcome to use the app, no matter the background. In a typical setting, it is evening and 
                    the user's day is about over. The user will open the app on their phones to begin journaling at home. 
                </p>
    
                <h3>Plans and Execution:</h3>
                <p>
                    The research method I used for the contextual inquiry was an interview and survey method, including both direct questions, 
                    indirect questions, and participatory observation. I will ask the participant questions regarding on how the participant 
                    de-stresses, whether or not the participant journals, and the participant's preferences for an ideal health-app. 
                </p>
                <h3>Contextual Inquiry Reflection:</h3>
                <p>
                    The contextual inquiry was helpful in gauging the user's interest. By observing and talking to the users, it will definitely 
                    help me generate ideas on how to make a better app regarding journaling, such as including and excluding certain things. 
                    Next time, I will try to create my own questionnaire because the template had a lot of repeating questions and it made 
                    the participant repeat herself a lot of times.

                <h3>Scenario 1– Quincy:</h3>
                <p>
                    It is Monday 5pm. Quincy is still at the library studying and finishing his homework due the next day. However, he couldn’t focus 100% 
                    because he received his midterm grades back and he got a 75% on it. This made him feel disappointed and disconsolate, impacting his 
                    studying. He heads home at 6pm to make and eat dinner. After eating, he proceeds to study in his room. At 9pm, his phone buzzes. He 
                    receives a reminder from a journaling app he recently downloaded to write an entry down. He taps on the reminder and he is redirected to the 
                    app. He chooses to freewrite. He names his entry "Sad grades". He begins to write down what happened with his exam grade and how he plans to fix his grade. 
                    After he finished journaling, he clicks on the check button to confirm his entry and he receives a message that he leveled up to Level 2 
                    for journaling for 5 consecutive days!
                </p>
    
                <h3>Scenario 2– Quincy:</h3>
                <p>
                    It is November. Quincy is back home in Seattle, Washington and he has been feeling a bit down lately. He is afraid he has been affected 
                    by seasonal depression. He gets triggered from his past events. He decides to journal in hopes that he can sort out his thoughts and emotions. 
                    He opens his journaling app and chooses to freewrite about what he has been thinking about and why he feels a type of way about it. He names his entry "Contemplating 
                    about my own thoughts". After finishing, he confirms his entry and rereads his journal. Quincy decides to journal about the same topic for a week. 
                    Everyday, for a week, he would title his entry the same title and add the number of days he has been journaling on the same topic, for example, "Contemplating 
                    about my own thoughts– 2", "Contemplating about my own thoughts– 3", so forth and so on. After a week is over, he clicks on the log button from the bottom navigation
                    bar and filters his past entries. He types in the year and selects "November" to read November's entries. He rereads his journals from the past week and 
                    tries to find the trigger points to what makes him sad. He starts to think about the positive in each situation to reconstruct his thinking about the past event. 
                    So now, whenever his mind wanders off and thinks about sad events, he will recognize it and try to think positive thoughts.

                <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
                <p>
                    My project is a journaling app intended to improve mental health. This app allows the users to either freewrite or choose a topic to talk 
                    about. Additionally, the user can level up and unlock incentives depending on how consistent they journal. By being consistent with journaling, 
                    it can help users clear their minds, draw connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and even buffer or reduce the effects of mental 
                    illness.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Login Page:</h3>
                <p>
                    For the login page, the user is able to login by clicking the “Log In” button after entering their username and password. If the user forgets 
                    their password, they are able to reset their password by clicking on the “Forgot Password” button, which then will redirect them to the “Forgot 
                    Password” screen. If the user has not yet created an account, they are able to sign up by clicking on the “Sign Up” button. 
                </p>
    
                <h3>Sign up Page: </h3>
                <p>
                    To sign up, the new user will have to enter their name, email, birthday, and create a username and password. They have the option of adding 
                    a profile picture. To confirm everything, the user will click the “Confirm” button on the bottom. They will get redirected to the home page 
                    after this step. 
                </p>
    
                <h3>Homepage:</h3>
                <p>
                    The homepage will be a bunch of shortcuts that can take the user to create a new entry, view their profile, gallery, and to look at external 
                    resources to help the users with journaling. On the bottom navigation bar, the user can always get redirected to the home page by clicking 
                    on the home icon.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Create New Entry:</h3> 
                <p>
                    To create a new entry, the user will click on the “write” button on the bottom navigation bar. After being redirected, the user will have 
                    the option to create a new free write entry or to choose a topic to write about. 
                </p>
    
                <h3>Create New Entry– Freewrite:</h3>
                <p>
                    On the free write entry screen, the user can give their entry a title and add media (photo, video, or draw). 
                </p>
    
                <h3>Create New Entry– Choose a Topic:</h3>
                <p>
                    On this screen, the user will be presented with a list of topic to choose from. After clicking on a topic, I planned for the next screen 
                    to display the topic as the title, and below, there will be some questions about the topic, so the user can have ideas to start journaling about. 
                </p>
    
                <h3>Profile:</h3>
                <p>
                    For the profile page, it will have the user's profile picture and current level on the top. On the middle of the page, the user will be able to see 
                    their monthly streak of how consistent they were in journaling. Near the bottom of the page, there will be a list of unlocked incentive they have 
                    earned for being consistent with journaling. 
                </p>
    
                <h3>Settings:</h3>
                <p>
                    The setting page has privacy, notification, security, FAQ and a log out option for the user. 
                </p>
    
                <h3>Logs:</h3>
                <p>
                    This page contains all the past journal entry the user has written. The organization of this will be by date and month. 
                </p>
    
                <h3>A list of tasks that the paper prototype of my system supported:</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Signing up</li>
                        <li>Changing profile picture, checking current level and their monthly streak</li>
                        <li>Going back to the home screen</li>
                        <li>Adding a video/picture to the entries</li>

                        <li>Checking past entry logs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
    
                <h3>Notes From My Prototype Being Tested:</h3>

                </p>
    
                <h3>What I Would Change Based on Feedback from the Tester:</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the data I obtained from the prototype testing, I noticed that the “creating entry page” might be confusing 
                    because the tester seemed to have gotten confused for a quick second. From this, I would make the "creating entry page" 
                    button more apparent by having a icon that represents adding , such as the "+" sign.
                </p>
    
                <h3>What I changed After the Feedback:</h3>
                <p>
                    I decided to change the "write" button on the bottom navigation into a "+" icon because it is a universal icon of "adding something". 
                    Additionally, I changed the homescreen. Instead of having shortcuts that can be found on the bottom navigation bar on the homescreen, 
                    I decided to give the user the option to explore external resources, save and bookmark the external resources, view their gallery, 
                    and export their journals. Moreover, I decided to change the freewrite page and the log page. For the freewrite page, I realized 
                    the user has no way to "save" their entries, so I added a "check" button on the top bar. For the log page, I changed the organization 
                    of the logs; instead of organizing by month and date, I decided to do by month and year to minimize the cognitive load.

                <p>
                    For the color scheme and font, I decided to go with the screen labeled "Login" because I wanted to have a darker theme. I also chose 
                    this font (Baskerville) because it has an accent on the end of every horizontal and vertical line, making the text seem more decorate, 
                    ultimately making the app more decorative. For the home page design, I decided to go with "Home Page v3" because I thought the left one looked a bit dull and boring, and the 
                    buttons (inspiration, tips, etc.) were too far apart and might cause frustration for the users when they are trying to select a button. 
                    So, in "Home Page v3", I miniaturized the buttons and added a picture on the top for aesthetics.

                <h2>Usability Evaluation</h2>

                <h3>About the Usability Test:</h3>
                <p>
                    The usability test took place at UCLA. The room contained a desk, a laptop to record the test, the moderator and the participant. 
                    The test was conducted to test how easy and intuitive the designs of the app were in regard to the tasks.  The participant was 
                    asked to complete three tasks: creating a free write journal, editing an old entry, and choosing a topic to journal about. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>Major Findings:</h3>
                <p>
                    The major findings from this usability tests were that the home page was too “stressful” from all the different buttons and that I 
                    didn’t need the “+” icon on the bottom. The participant ultimately was most confused about the redundancy of the bottom navigation bar
                    and felt overwhelmed from the home page. 
                </p>
    
                <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                <p>
                    The usability test was helpful in generating ideas on how to further improve the prototype 
                    and increase the ease of use. I decided to change the bottom navigation bar and remove the “+” icon. The home page, instead, will 
                    be where the users are able to select to either free write a new entry or to choose a topic to talk about. Additionally, I moved 
                    majority of the buttons from the previous homepage (for example, the gallery button) into the menu/setting screen because that way, 
                    the home screen will feel less overwhelming from all the different buttons.

                <hr class="img_hr">
                <h3>Rationale:</h3>
                <p>
                    In the redesign, I changed the bottom navigation bar to only contain 4 buttons instead of 5 because the "add" icon was repetitive. If I kept the home
                    button and the "add" button, the home button will be sort of useless. However, I wanted to keep the home button, so from the feedback I obtained through 
                    the usability testing, I moved the adding entry option onto the homepage. In short, I took away the “add” icon, and made the homepage the official screen 
                    to add new entries. I also redesigned the setting/menu page, so that the the information will feel less overwhelming and more simple. The menu/setting screen
                    is now in the format of a list instead of a grid because it is more minimalistic in my opinion and I don't have to come up with an icon for each selection; the 
                    user can easily read the options and select.
